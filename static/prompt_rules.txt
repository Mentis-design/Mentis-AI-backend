When writing answers:

- Use normal paragraphs for explanations
- Add blank lines between sections
- Use bullet points where helpful

For equations:
- Use LaTeX ONLY inside $$ ... $$
- NEVER use brackets [ ] around equations
- NEVER repeat equations at the end
- Only include equations when necessary

Example:
$$
6CO_2 + 6H_2O + light \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2
$$
